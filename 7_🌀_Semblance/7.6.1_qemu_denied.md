Could not access KVM kernel module: Permission denied
qemu-system-x86_64: failed to initialize KVM: Permission denied
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces $ 

---

The "Permission denied" error indicates that your user does not have the necessary permissions to access the KVM kernel module. Here are a few steps to resolve this issue:

### **1. Add Your User to the KVM Group**
Add your user to the `kvm` group to grant the necessary permissions:
```sh
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
```
After running this command, you need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

### **2. Verify KVM Group Membership**
Check if your user is part of the `kvm` group:
```sh
groups $USER
```
You should see `kvm` listed among the groups.

### **3. Check KVM Device Permissions**
Ensure that the KVM device has the correct permissions:
```sh
ls -l /dev/kvm
```
The output should show that the `kvm` group has read and write permissions:
```sh
crw-rw----+ 1 root kvm 10, 232 Mar 27 16:05 /dev/kvm
```

### **4. Restart the Codespace**
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try restarting your Codespace to ensure all changes take effect.

### **Running the QEMU Command Again**
Once you have the necessary permissions, run the QEMU command again:
```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -cpu host -smp 2 \
  -drive file=/workspaces/PipelineAutomation/qemu/windows-server.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
  -cdrom /workspaces/PipelineAutomation/qemu/26100.1742.240906-0331.ge_release_svc_refresh_SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso \
  -drive file=/workspaces/PipelineAutomation/qemu/virtio-win.iso,media=cdrom \
  -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::3389-:3389 \
  -nographic
```

These steps should help you resolve the permission issue and successfully run your QEMU virtual machine. If you encounter any further issues or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
