It looks like the error is due to a platform mismatch. The `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019` image is a Windows-based image, and it seems your environment is set to use Linux containers. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Switch Docker to Windows Containers**:
   - If you're using Docker Desktop, right-click the Docker icon in the system tray and select "Switch to Windows containers...".

2. **Specify the Platform in Dockerfile**:
   - Modify your Dockerfile to specify the platform:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM --platform=windows mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019
     RUN Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services
     ```

3. **Build the Image**:
   - Build the Docker image again:
     ```sh
     docker build -t ad-image .
     ```

If you're running this in a Linux-based environment like GitHub Codespaces, you won't be able to use Windows-based images directly. Instead, you can use a Linux-based alternative for Active Directory services, such as Samba or FreeIPA.

Would you like guidance on setting up a Linux-based AD alternative?

Running Windows-based containers directly in GitHub Codespaces is currently not supported[1](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/9977). Codespaces primarily use Linux-based containers, which means Windows-based images like `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019` won't work.

However, you can explore alternatives such as:

1. **Using QEMU for Virtualization**:
   - You can run Windows 10 in GitHub Codespaces using QEMU for virtualization[2](https://www.aih.app/2023/02/04/run-windows-10-for-free-in-github-codespaces-using-qemu/). This involves setting up a virtual machine within your Codespace, but it may not be ideal for daily development due to performance limitations.

2. **Microsoft Dev Box**:
   - Microsoft Dev Box provides cloud-based Windows VMs that support Visual Studio and other Windows development tools[1](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/9977). This could be a more robust solution for developing and testing Windows-based applications.

Would you like more details on setting up QEMU in Codespaces or exploring Microsoft Dev Box?

3. **Join Active Directory**:
   - You can use either Microsoft Entra join or Microsoft Entra hybrid join to integrate your Dev Boxes with Active Directory[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/how-to-configure-network-connections).
   - For hybrid join, ensure you have the necessary network connectivity to your on-premises Active Directory.

4. **Create and Configure Dev Boxes**:
   - Define your Dev Box configurations, including the necessary software and tools.
   - Create Dev Box pools and assign them to your development teams.
   - Developers can then self-serve their Dev Boxes from the developer portal[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service).

5. **Manage and Access Dev Boxes**:
   - Use the Azure portal to manage your Dev Boxes and ensure they are properly connected to your Active Directory.
   - Developers can access their Dev Boxes securely and start working on their projects.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to the Microsoft Dev Box documentation[3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service).

Choosing between Microsoft Dev Box and QEMU for an on-premise Active Directory setup depends on your specific needs and environment:

### **Microsoft Dev Box**
- **Cloud-Based Solution**: Dev Box is designed for cloud-based development environments, providing scalability and flexibility[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/concept-dev-box-network-requirements).
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: You can integrate Dev Boxes with on-premise Active Directory using Microsoft Entra hybrid join[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/concept-dev-box-deployment-guide). This allows you to leverage cloud resources while maintaining connectivity to your on-premise AD.
- **Ease of Use**: Dev Boxes are pre-configured and managed through Azure, making setup and maintenance straightforward[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/concept-dev-box-network-requirements).

### **QEMU**
- **On-Premise Virtualization**: QEMU is a powerful open-source virtualization tool that can run Windows-based VMs on Linux hosts[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/x4lhm9/how_much_on_premise_active_directory_and_windows/).
- **Full Control**: Using QEMU gives you complete control over your environment, allowing you to configure and manage your AD setup as needed[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/x4lhm9/how_much_on_premise_active_directory_and_windows/).
- **Resource Intensive**: Running QEMU requires significant local resources and expertise in managing virtual machines[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/x4lhm9/how_much_on_premise_active_directory_and_windows/).

### **Considerations**
- **Dev Box** is ideal if you prefer a cloud-based solution with easy integration and management.
- **QEMU** is suitable if you need full control over your on-premise environment and have the resources to manage it.

If you need more detailed guidance on either option, feel free to ask! Which setup are you leaning towards?
