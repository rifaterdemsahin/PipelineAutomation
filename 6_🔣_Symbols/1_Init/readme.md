The `init` folder is designed to set up the project's structure. It is bypassed during execution, which makes sense since its purpose is solely to create the foundational layout.

### 🔄 Iterative Improvements
After a few iterations in **DeliveryPilot**, the `init` folder can be removed to avoid confusion for anyone pulling and implementing the project.
