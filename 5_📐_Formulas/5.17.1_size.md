To list files in a directory with their sizes in gigabytes (GB), you can use the `ls` command along with `awk` for formatting. Here's a one-liner command to achieve this:

```sh
ls -lh --block-size=G | awk '{print $9, $5}'
```

This command does the following:
- `ls -lh --block-size=G`: Lists files with human-readable sizes in gigabytes.
- `awk '{print $9, $5}'`: Prints the filename and its size.

If you want to include hidden files and directories, you can use:

```sh
ls -lah --block-size=G | awk '{print $9, $5}'
```

This will give you a list of all files and directories in the current directory with their sizes in gigabytes. If you need further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!
