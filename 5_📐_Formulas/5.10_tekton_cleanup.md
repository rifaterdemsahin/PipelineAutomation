To delete all Tekton-related resources, you can use `kubectl` commands to delete the specific Tekton resource types. Here are the steps:

1. **Delete Pipelines**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pipelines --all
   ```

2. **Delete PipelineRuns**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pipelineruns --all
   ```

3. **Delete Tasks**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete tasks --all
   ```

4. **Delete TaskRuns**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete taskruns --all
   ```

5. **Delete ClusterTasks** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   kubectl delete clustertasks --all
   ```

6. **Delete PipelineResources** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pipelineresources --all
   ```

You can also use the Tekton CLI (`tkn`) to delete these resources:
```bash
tkn pipeline delete --all
tkn pipelinerun delete --all
tkn task delete --all
tkn taskrun delete --all
```

If you need to delete Tekton-related resources across multiple namespaces, you can specify the namespace in your commands:
```bash
kubectl delete pipelines --all -n <namespace>
kubectl delete pipelineruns --all -n <namespace>
kubectl delete tasks --all -n <namespace>
kubectl delete taskruns --all -n <namespace>
```

You can combine these commands into a single one-liner using `&&` to execute them sequentially:

```bash
tkn pipeline delete --all && tkn pipelinerun delete --all && tkn task delete --all && tkn taskrun delete --all
```

This will ensure that all Tekton-related resources are deleted in sequence. If you need to delete resources across multiple namespaces, you can add the `-n <namespace>` flag to each command.
