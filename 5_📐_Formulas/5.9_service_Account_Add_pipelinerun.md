It seems like the issue persists even after recreating the pipeline. Here are a few more steps to try:

1. **Recreate the PipelineRun**:
   Delete the existing PipelineRun and create a new one:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pipelinerun echo-date-pipeline-run
   kubectl apply -f tekton/pipelinerun.yaml
   ```

2. **Check PipelineRun YAML**:
   Ensure that the PipelineRun YAML file correctly references the `echo-date-pipeline`. Here is an example of what the PipelineRun YAML should look like:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
   kind: PipelineRun
   metadata:
     name: echo-date-pipeline-run
   spec:
     pipelineRef:
       name: echo-date-pipeline
     serviceAccountName: default
   ```

3. **Verify Resource Availability**:
   Ensure that all resources required by the pipeline are available and correctly configured.

4. **Tekton Controller Logs**:
   Continue to monitor the Tekton controller logs for any additional errors or warnings:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app=tekton-pipelines-controller -n tekton-pipelines
   ```

5. **Tekton Community Support**:
   If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the Tekton community for support.
