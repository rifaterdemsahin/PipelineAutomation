To watch the output of your Tekton pipelines, you can use the `tkn` CLI tool. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the Tekton CLI (`tkn`)** if you haven't already. You can find the installation instructions here.

2. **View the logs** of your PipelineRun using the following command:
   ```bash
   tkn pipelinerun logs echo-date-pipeline-run -f
   ```
   This command will stream the logs of the `echo-date-pipeline-run` PipelineRun[1](https://tekton.dev/docs/getting-started/pipelines/).

3. **Check the status** of your PipelineRun:
   ```bash
   tkn pipelinerun describe echo-date-pipeline-run
   ```
   This will provide detailed information about the PipelineRun, including the status of each task[1](https://tekton.dev/docs/getting-started/pipelines/).

Additionally, you can use the **Kubernetes Dashboard** to inspect the individual components of your Tekton pipelines, such as pods and services[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/tektonCICD/comments/18lzdgu/ways_to_debug_tekton_pipelines/).

Feel free to ask if you need more help with Tekton or anything else! ðŸ˜Š
