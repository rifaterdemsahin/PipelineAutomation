Sure! Here's how you can update the example to work with Minikube:

1. **Create a Role**: Define a role with the necessary permissions.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: pipeline-role
      namespace: your-namespace
    rules:
    - apiGroups: ["tekton.dev"]
      resources: ["pipelines", "pipelineruns", "tasks", "taskruns"]
      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "delete"]
    ```

2. **Create a RoleBinding**: Bind the role to a user or service account.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: pipeline-role-binding
      namespace: your-namespace
    subjects:
    - kind: User
      name: your-username
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: pipeline-role
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

3. **Apply the YAML files**: Use `kubectl` to apply the YAML files in your Minikube environment.
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f role.yaml
    kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
    ```

This setup will grant a user access to manage Tekton pipelines and related resources within a specific namespace in your Minikube cluster. You can adjust the `rules` section to fit your specific needs[1](https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/authentication/using-rbac.html)[2](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7//authentication/using-rbac.html).
